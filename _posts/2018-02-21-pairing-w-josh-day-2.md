title: 'Pairing w/ Josh: Day 2'
---

The second day was a lot more of the same. Long feedback loops, bash debugging, configuring of configuration files, client stress level rising, promises of a _friday off_, one step forward, one step back.

It's worth mentioning that each day I began to notice more of the interplay between the client, client teammates, crafters, and 8th Light. Before I go any further I should probably mention that Josh has clearly spent time and energy on honing the skills it takes to deal with people while dealing with software.  Aaron was also a stud on this front but mostly took the reigns of tackling the technical aspects of the engagement and supporting Josh, while he was fighting to keep things in perspective for the client teammate we were working with.

Throughout the first and second day both Josh and Aaron arose frustrations with a lack of sustainable process, ability to test, and the _crush of the rush_. They didn't offer up these criticisms in a way that was demeaning or damanging to the relationship but more so vigilantly reminded the client that there are better ways to build, integrate, and manage software, and that our specialty and value really is precisely in bringing those changes in _process_ to our clients.  This was meant throughout the week by our client teammate, with both total frustration, and curious adoration.  Usually in that order.

Sometime around the middle of day 2 I was fortunate enough to sit on a call between Gustin and Josh to discuss the situation and sync up. One thing I've noticed since coming to 8th Light and pervaded this call is stoicism. There's real value in being able to step back from a situtation you're in and calmly address present difficulty without letting emotions take hold of how you react. I'm a very reactionary person outside of emergency situations. I lost my ability to knee-jerk to emergencies at some point in the Marine Corps, either because I saw how harmful freaking out is when it comes from leadership or because I simply became desensitized to _emergencies_... Either way outside of emergencies I do tend to be reactionary which is something I'll try to improve looking forward because I saw the benefit of maintaining a consistent affect toward the client in the face of their perceived impending doom.

This was the first day that the client teammate stopped all work to have a nice tense discussion as a team. Josh was super direct during these conversations and did not lay down or give into the client's *Extreme* energy during these conversations. 8th Lighter's did not start these fights, but as far as I could tell we did end them, through assertiveness, confidence, and empathy.

Josh had at one point mentioned to the client that it felt like we were _throwing a hail mary_ to the client, to which the client rejoiced, "Yes! That is a perfect way to put it! We are throwing a hail mary!" Clearly, he failed to see the point, there's an obvious problem with _hail mary_'s.  They rarely work, and even when they do, it means there was improper preparation for winning.  We don't want to leave games up to chance... I made some comment along those lines after noticing the client didn't really get the metaphor but it was the end of the day and wasn't sticking, so we packed up and prepared for another nail biter the next day.

Client stress level on a scale of 1-10:
Day Start: 7
Day End: 8
(and I think it would have been an 11 already were it not for the bedside manner and ability to deliver demonstarted by Josh and Aaron)
