# Agility +8XP

I remember as a kid, agility, was a super important attribute to claim while 
playing with my older brother and his friends, who of course had a fearsome 
ninja gang that rode rollerblades around the neighborhood in between slaming 
down streetwise games of POGS.  Why did these kids respect agility so much? 
It's because they were kind of nerdy and agility was a means for overcoming 
any lack of XP in strength, speed, or dextirity.  With Agility, one could jump 
over & dance circles around enemies that focused on glamour traits. Agility in 
that right represented a kind of old-soul wisdom. It represented knowing that 
the ability to adapt to change will always be more valuable over time than any 
attribute gained in conformation to the more attractive, popular, and shiny 
traits a ninja may have. Agility is a timeless skillset.

# Software Industry Experts Eventually Caught up to my Brother's Gang 

So at some point in the not so distant past (c. 2001) after noticing an 
overabundance of process inflation... by which I mean beaurocratic nonsense 
infecting the _getting shtuff done_ factor of software teams, aka: [rigamarole](http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rigmarole?q=rigmarole), a group of [Software Ninjas](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnVjoMVWcAAgtLw.png),
 decided that the best thing they could do to manage this overgrowing 
hinderance, was to create a guiding ideal that established agility as the 
ultimate goal of software teams and their development efforts...


# The Manifesto

<blockquote>

We are uncovering better ways of developing<br>
software by doing it and helping others do it.<br>
Through this work we have come to value:<br>

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
Responding to change over following a plan<br>

That is, while there is value in the items on<br>
the right, we value the items on the left more.<br>

</blockquote>

Without having worked any substantial amount (*cough* imposter *cough*)on a 
professional software team, I still find truth in this manifesto.  My favorite 
part, or at least the part I find most agreeable is the line, '_Responding to 
change over following a plan_...' It makes me think back to the Marine Corps 
infantry where I saw incredibly descript plans fall apart in the field, and I 
witnessed leaders, myself included, rise and degrade in the face of such 
change. As a matter of fact, in every line of the Agile manifesto, even the 
first\* requires a stretch of the imagination, I can find a related ideal I 
gathered from my time on rifleteams in the Marine Corps.

\* _**Individuals** and interactions over processes and tools_

# BAMCIS!
The idea of responding to change though, is one that peaks my curiousity 
most.  In the USMC before any mission, a ginormous protocol called, a [
5-paragraph order](http://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/FMTBE/Student%20Materials/FMST/209.pdf)
was drawn up. Despite the name, they were never 5 paragraphs. This process at 
first glance is not unlike the _Waterfall_ process most software teams 
followed before Agile practices were established. I think similarly to 
waterfall methodologies, boots on the ground ( ...or in the case of a 
software team, the junior developers), were not expected to be involved in 
the team mission/objective process at a high-level. 

The difference is that in my experience, their was a great deal of flexibility 
and team culture that was decided by the individual members of small 3-4 
Marine teams. [Junior enlisted were lead at the lowest level, where small-unit 
leaders can make adjustments](http://www.bsa325.org/bsa325/blogengine/file.axd?file=2013%2F7%2FSmall+Unit+Leadership.pdf) without creating a conflict with or 
distracting from a rifle-team member's individual & immediate actions ( 
...passing test by writing code that solves specific problems they encounter 
along the way of completing a story). It goes without saying, that not all 
small-unit leaders did this effectively, but I think mine did a decent job of 
creating a highly effective team for a couple of teenagers in charge of 
teenagers at war.  Software projects are an awful lot like [conducting patrols]
(http://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/TBS/B2H3317%20Patrolling%20Operations.pdf?ver=2015-03-26-101420-157), beside the *ACTUAL* fear of death for you and your teammates, when done right, there 
should be a similar safety and shared responsibility for making the hardest 
and most uncertain of tasks, the most enjoyable to complete. This is what I 
imagine, makes teams with high agility. 

All of this revoles around accomplishing a mission.  Which in my mind is the goal of incorporating agile practices.

I'll end with 2 Agile principles that drew my focus in PPP's Agile Practices 
chapter and which I think I need to catalyze:
<hr>
<blockquote><em>Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not 
done.——is essential.</em></blockquote>
<br>

<blockquote><em>Priority - ...satisfy... ...through... ...continuous delivery 
of valu—...</em></blockquote>
