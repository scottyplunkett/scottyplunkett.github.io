  This post is intended to give a summation of the 4 most common computer science idioms used to express type systems.  While there are various combinations of static vs. dynamic, and strong vs. weak type systems, an understanding of these two basic dichotomies will enable a general understanding of how type systems affect our code and how we encode it.  I decided to write this after I corrected my mentor on Erlang's (dynamic) type system, although he correctly described the type system, he used the wrong nomenclature... And even though I corrected him on the nomenclature, I didn't really understand what was in the name.

  I thought it might be a good idea to familiarize myself with these stranger types.  So sit back, shave your head, and let's turn the geekery up to integer 11!

# What's a Type
  A type is *drum roll*...
  A <b>DATA TYPE</b>!!

  I know this may seem obvious to the average programmer but inference aside, I've found the terms <em>type</em> and <em>data type</em> are used different colloquially.  

  The fact is that <em>typing</em> gives a richer meaning to a sequence of bits.  To put this in perspective, try to imagine if your processor or compiler couldn't tell the difference between a string and a list of numbers...  It'd be like you were programming in Erlang or something!

# Check your Type, Before you Wreck your Type

  The first thing we need to talk about is type checking.  Type checking describes when the process of verifying and enforcing contraints on types occurs.

dynamic
strong
weak typing
