  This post is intended to give a summation of the 4 most common computer science idioms used to express type systems.  While there are various combinations of static vs. dynamic, and strong vs. weak type systems, an understanding of these two basic dichotomies will enable a general understanding of how type systems affect our code and how we encode it.  I decided to write this after I corrected my mentor on Erlang's (dynamic) type system, although he correctly described the type system, he used the wrong nomenclature... And even though I corrected him on the nomenclature, I didn't really understand what was in the name.  

  I thought it might be a good idea to familiarize myself with these stranger types.  So sit back, shave your head, and let's turn the geekery up to integer 11!
