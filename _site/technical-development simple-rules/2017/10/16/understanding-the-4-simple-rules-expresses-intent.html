    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This week I was assigned the reading, <em>Understanding The 4 Rules of Simple Design</em> by, Corey Haines.  The following series of post are my thoughts on each of the rules and some notes on how Corey helps us understand them.</p>

<h1 id="expresses-intent">Expresses Intent</h1>

<h3 id="expresses">Expresses</h3>

<p>This almost seems like it should go without saying but in practice is much harder to incorporate than a lot of the other primary skills we’re asked to develop as crafters.</p>

<p>I think another way to say this would be, “Write code that other people can read…”</p>

<p>Go take a look around stack overflow.  Do you see a lot of X’s, Y’s, and aliased variables that represent working code that is nearly impossible to digest?  I do.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G8c4eXx.jpg" alt="explain that to me like i'm 5" /></p>

<p>The above image from the office should give you a good idea of the situation we are trying to avoid.  If we stay focused on the fact that we aren’t writing code for ourselves and we exhibit self-lessness in attuning our descriptors, be they method/function names, class/modules names, etc., than we give other people the chance to appreciate our code the way we do.</p>

<h3 id="intent">Intent</h3>

<p>The second word of the phrase is <b>INTENT</b>.</p>

<p>This extends out the meaning behind this rule.  One could say, “Write code that other people can read… and speaks to the intended behavior of the code.”</p>

<p>This means there is a difference between</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">input</span>
	<span class="nb">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_console_input_from_client</span>
	<span class="nb">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the example is a little simplified but you get the point.</p>

<p>We want to be specific about the intended behavior of our code so that others can clearly parse through our application and see when, where, and why a piece of functionality was brought in to the code base.  It also gives us the opportunity to write more expressive test and extend our code between its parts easier.</p>
